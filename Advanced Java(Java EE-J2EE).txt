1) Can you explain the lifecycle of a servlet?

Loading and Instantiation: 
	The servlet is loaded by the servlet container and an instance is created when the server starts or when it's first accessed.

Initialization (init() Method): 
	The servlet is initialized by calling the init() method, where setup tasks like reading configuration parameters are done.
	init() method called only ones.

Request Handling (service() Method): 
	For each client request, the service() method is called. It processes the request and generates the response.
	Concurrency: The service() method can handle multiple requests concurrently by creating new threads for each request, 
	ensuring that the servlet can process many clients simultaneously.

Response: 
	The servlet sends the response back to the client.

Destruction (destroy() Method): 
	When the server shuts down or the servlet is unloaded, the destroy() method is called for cleanup, releasing resources before the servlet is discarded.

# 1. What are the main features introduced in Java 8?

Java 8 introduced several important features, the most notable being:
- Lambda Expressions: A new way to write anonymous methods (functional programming style).
- Streams API: A new abstraction to process sequences of data (collections, arrays, etc.) in a declarative and parallelizable manner.
- Default Methods: Methods in interfaces that have a body, allowing interfaces to evolve without breaking existing implementations.
- Method References: A shorthand notation for calling a method (similar to lambda expressions but more concise).
- Optional Class: A container for objects that may be null, reducing null pointer exceptions and making code cleaner.
- New Date and Time API: The `java.time` package, which improves upon the old `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar`.
- Nashorn JavaScript Engine: A new JavaScript engine that replaces the older Rhino engine.
- Parallel Streams: For easier parallel processing of collections.

# 2. What are Lambda expressions in Java 8? Can you give an example?

Lambda expressions allow you to treat functionality as a method argument, or to create a small function that can be passed around. 
It enables functional programming in Java by providing a clear and concise way to express instances of single-method interfaces (functional interfaces).

Syntax:
```java
(parameters) -> expression
```

Example:
```java
// Traditional anonymous class
Runnable r = new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Hello from Runnable");
    }
};

// Lambda expression
Runnable r = () -> System.out.println("Hello from Runnable");
```
In the above example, the `Runnable` interface is implemented using a lambda expression instead of an anonymous class.

---

# 3. What is a functional interface in Java?

A functional interface is an interface that has only one abstract method, and it may have multiple default or static methods. 
These interfaces can be used with lambda expressions and method references.

The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation is used to indicate that an interface is a functional interface, but it’s not required.

Example:
```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    void myMethod(); // single abstract method
}
```

Java 8 has built-in functional interfaces like `Runnable`, `Callable`, `Comparator`, etc.

---

# 4. What is the `Stream` API in Java 8 and how is it different from traditional iteration?

The `Stream` API is introduced in Java 8 to process collections of objects in a functional-style way. 
It supports operations like map, filter, reduce, and more, allowing you to process data declaratively and efficiently.

Key Differences from Traditional Iteration:
- Declarative: You describe what you want to do, not how (e.g., filtering a list of strings that contain the letter "a").
- Lazy Evaluation: Operations on streams are lazy and are only executed when a terminal operation (like `collect()`, `forEach()`) is invoked.
- Parallel Processing: Streams can be processed in parallel easily using `parallelStream()`.

Example:
```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "David", "Diana");

// Using Stream
names.stream()
     .filter(name -> name.startsWith("J"))
     .forEach(System.out::println);  // Prints John and Jane
```

---

# 5. Explain the difference between `map()` and `flatMap()` in Streams.

- `map()`: Transforms each element of the stream into another object, producing a new stream where each element is transformed by the provided function.
- `flatMap()`: Flattens the structure of the stream. If the function applied to each element produces a stream itself, 
			   `flatMap()` merges these multiple streams into a single stream.

Example of `map()`:
```java
List<String> words = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry");
List<Integer> wordLengths = words.stream()
                                 .map(String::length)  // Converts each string to its length
                                 .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(wordLengths);  // [5, 6, 6]
```

Example of `flatMap()`:
```java
List<List<String>> listOfLists = Arrays.asList(
    Arrays.asList("apple", "banana"),
    Arrays.asList("cherry", "date")
);
List<String> flattened = listOfLists.stream()
                                    .flatMap(List::stream)  // Flattens the list of lists
                                    .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(flattened);  // [apple, banana, cherry, date]
```
---

# 6. What is the `Optional` class in Java 8?

`Optional` is a container object which may or may not contain a value. 
It’s used to avoid `NullPointerExceptions` and provides methods for more functional-style handling of `null` values.

Common methods:
- `Optional.of(value)`: Returns an Optional containing the value, or throws `NullPointerException` if the value is `null`.
- `Optional.empty()`: Returns an empty Optional.
- `Optional.isPresent()`: Returns `true` if the value is present, `false` otherwise.
- `Optional.ifPresent(Consumer)`: If a value is present, it performs the provided action.
- `Optional.orElse(value)`: Returns the value if present, otherwise returns the given default value.

Example:
```java
Optional<String> name = Optional.ofNullable("John");
name.ifPresent(System.out::println);  // Prints John

Optional<String> emptyName = Optional.ofNullable(null);
System.out.println(emptyName.orElse("Default Name"));  // Prints Default Name
```
---

# 7. What are Default Methods in interfaces and why were they introduced?

Default methods are methods in interfaces that have a body. They were introduced in Java 8 to allow backward compatibility. 
They enable developers to add new methods to interfaces without breaking the existing implementation of classes.

Syntax:
```java
interface MyInterface {
    default void defaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a default method.");
    }
}
```

Example:
```java
interface MyInterface {
    default void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello from the interface!");
    }
}

class MyClass implements MyInterface {}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.greet();  // Prints: Hello from the interface!
    }
}
```
---

# 8. Explain the new Date/Time API in Java 8.

The `java.time` package introduced in Java 8 is a major improvement over the old `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` classes. 
It is immutable, thread-safe, and has a clearer API for handling dates, times, and durations.

Important Classes:
- `LocalDate`: Represents a date without time (e.g., 2024-11-30).
- `LocalTime`: Represents a time without date (e.g., 15:30).
- `LocalDateTime`: Combines both date and time.
- `ZonedDateTime`: Represents date and time with time zone information.
- `Duration`: Represents a time-based amount of time.
- `Period`: Represents a date-based amount of time.

Example:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2024, 11, 30);
LocalTime time = LocalTime.of(14, 30);
LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.of(date, time);
System.out.println(dateTime);  // Prints 2024-11-30T14:30
```
---

# 9. What is the difference between `forEach()` and `forEachOrdered()` in Java 8 streams?

- `forEach()`: Performs an action for each element in the stream. It may not preserve the order of elements in a parallel stream.
- `forEachOrdered()`: Ensures that the elements are processed in the encounter order 
					  (i.e., the order they appeared in the original stream) even in parallel streams.

Example:
```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry");

// Sequential stream
list.stream().forEach(System.out::println);  // Prints in order

// Parallel stream
list.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);  // May not print in order

list.parallelStream().forEachOrdered(System.out::println);  // Ensures printing in order
```
---

# 10. What is the purpose of the `Collectors` class in Java 8?

The `Collectors` class provides a set of static methods that are used to collect the elements of a 
stream into various types of containers such as lists, sets, maps, and other collections.

Commonly used Collectors:
- `toList()`: Collects the elements into a `List`.
- `toSet()`: Collects the elements into a `Set`.
- `groupingBy()`: Groups the elements by a classifier function.
- `partitioningBy()`: Partitions the elements into two groups.
- `joining()`: Concatenates the elements into a string.

---

# 11. What is the difference between `Stream` and `Collection` in Java 8?

- Collection: A collection represents a group of objects, such as lists, sets, or maps, and provides operations to store and retrieve elements. 
			  Collections are eagerly evaluated, meaning they process elements as soon as you invoke a method on them.
  
- Stream: A stream is an abstraction for processing sequences of elements in a functional-style. 
		  Streams are lazy evaluated, meaning intermediate operations are not executed until a terminal operation (like `collect()`, `forEach()`) is invoked.

Key Differences:
- `Collection` is used to store data, while `Stream` is used to process data.
- `Collection` stores elements, whereas `Stream` provides a way to process data in a more declarative style.
- Streams can be processed in parallel easily, while collections don’t have such functionality out of the box.

Example:
```java
// Collection Example
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Alice");
for (String name : names) {
    System.out.println(name);
}

// Stream Example
names.stream()
     .filter(name -> name.startsWith("J"))
     .forEach(System.out::println);  // John, Jane
```
---

# 12. What is the use of `@FunctionalInterface` annotation in Java 8?

The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation is used to indicate that an interface is a functional interface, 
meaning it has exactly one abstract method and can be used as the target for lambda expressions or method references. 

This annotation is optional but helps to clearly define functional interfaces and ensures that the interface conforms 
to the rules of functional interfaces. If you accidentally add more than one abstract method, the compiler will throw an error.

Example:
```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunction {
    void apply();  // Single abstract method
}
```
---

# 13. What are the advantages of using `Stream` API in Java 8?

- Concise and Readable Code: The `Stream` API allows you to write more declarative code that is easier to understand and maintain.
- Parallel Processing: Streams provide an easy way to process data in parallel using `parallelStream()`, which improves performance for large datasets.
- Lazy Evaluation: Intermediate operations on streams are lazily evaluated, meaning computation is only done when a terminal operation is executed, improving performance.
- Functional Programming: The `Stream` API encourages a functional programming approach (e.g., using `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`), which leads to more modular and reusable code.
  
Example:
```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

// Summing up the numbers in a functional style
int sum = numbers.stream()
                  .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                  .mapToInt(Integer::intValue)
                  .sum();
System.out.println(sum);  // Output: 6 (2 + 4)
```
---

# 14. What is the difference between `map()` and `flatMap()` in Java 8 Streams?

- `map()`: The `map()` function transforms each element of the stream into another object, producing a 
		   new stream where each element is transformed by the provided function.
- `flatMap()`: The `flatMap()` function transforms each element into a stream of objects, and then flattens the resulting streams into a single stream.

Example of `map()`:
```java
List<String> words = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry");
List<Integer> lengths = words.stream()
                             .map(String::length)  // Maps each word to its length
                             .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(lengths);  // [5, 6, 6]
```
Example of `flatMap()`:
```java
List<List<String>> listOfLists = Arrays.asList(
    Arrays.asList("a", "b"),
    Arrays.asList("c", "d")
);
List<String> flatList = listOfLists.stream()
                                   .flatMap(List::stream)  // Flattens the lists
                                   .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(flatList);  // [a, b, c, d]
```
---

# 15. What is the `Collectors.groupingBy()` method in Java 8?

The `Collectors.groupingBy()` method is used to group elements of a stream by a classifier function. 
This method returns a `Map`, where the keys are the result of applying the classifier function, 
and the values are lists of items from the stream that correspond to those keys.

Syntax:
```java
Collectors.groupingBy(Function<? super T, ? extends K> classifier)
```

Example:
```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "David", "Diana");

// Grouping by first letter of the name
Map<Character, List<String>> groupedByLetter = names.stream()
                                                    .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(name -> name.charAt(0)));
System.out.println(groupedByLetter);
// Output: {J=[John, Jane], D=[David, Diana]}
```
---

# 16. What is the purpose of the `default` keyword in Java 8?

The `default` keyword in Java 8 is used to define methods with a body in an interface. 
These methods can have a default implementation, which allows interfaces to evolve without breaking the existing implementing classes.

Example:
```java
interface Animal {
    default void speak() {
        System.out.println("Animal is speaking");
    }
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    // No need to implement speak() method because it has a default implementation
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.speak();  // Output: Animal is speaking
    }
}
```
---

# 17. What is the difference between `findFirst()` and `findAny()` in Java 8 Streams?

- `findFirst()`: Returns the first element in the stream, according to the encounter order (if present).
- `findAny()`: Returns any element from the stream, and may be more efficient for parallel streams as it doesn’t need to preserve the encounter order.

Example:
```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "David", "Diana");

// Using findFirst()
String firstName = names.stream().findFirst().orElse("No name");
System.out.println(firstName);  // Output: John

// Using findAny() (may return any element, even in parallel streams)
String anyName = names.stream().findAny().orElse("No name");
System.out.println(anyName);  // Output: Any name from the list
```
---

# 18. What is the role of `reduce()` in Java 8 Streams?

The `reduce()` method is a terminal operation that combines elements of a stream into a single result. 
It performs a reduction of elements by repeatedly applying a combining function.

Syntax:
```java
T reduce(T identity, BinaryOperator<T> accumulator);
```

- `identity`: The identity value (often the initial value of the result).
- `accumulator`: A function that combines two elements of the stream.

Example:
```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

// Using reduce to sum up the numbers
int sum = numbers.stream()
                 .reduce(0, (a, b) -> a + b);
System.out.println(sum);  // Output: 15
```
---

# 19. What are `Consumer`, `Function`, and `Predicate` interfaces in Java 8?

- `Consumer<T>`: Represents an operation that takes a single argument of type `T` and returns no result. 
				 It’s used for operations that perform side effects.
  ```java
  Consumer<String> consumer = s -> System.out.println(s);
  ```

- `Function<T, R>`: Represents a function that takes an argument of type `T` and returns a result of type `R`.
  ```java
  Function<String, Integer> function = s -> s.length();
  ```

- `Predicate<T>`: Represents a boolean-valued function that takes an argument of type `T`. It is used for filtering and matching conditions.
  ```java
  Predicate<String> predicate = s -> s.length() > 5;
  ```
---

# 20. How does `java.util.function` package relate to Java 8?

The `java.util.function` package in Java 8 provides common functional interfaces that can be used to represent lambda expressions or method references. 
These interfaces support functional programming constructs, allowing more flexible, reusable, and concise code.

Key functional interfaces in this package include:
- `Function<T, R>`
- `Predicate<T>`
- `Consumer<T>`
- `Supplier<T>`
- `UnaryOperator<T>`
- `BinaryOperator<T>`
